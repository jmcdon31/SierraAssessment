# Spacecraft Attitude Control Software

## Guidelines:

- There are a wide variety of solutions here, it's up to you how simple or complicated you would like to approach this.
- The solution should be written in C++ and buildable in GCC 11 or Clang 14.
- No OS-specific libraries should be used.
- Explicit build instructions should be provided.
- This task can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 60+ minutes; it's up to you how much time you spend. The approach will be weighted the most.
- Be prepared to discuss your solution.
- Please ask questions if any clarification is needed.

## Task Description

You have been recruited to create software for a spacecraft. Specifically, you will create software that will change the spacecraftâ€™s attitude and determine which of the surrounding planets it is facing.

### Spacecraft Characteristics and Requirements:
1. The spacecraft has three Attitude Control Motors.
2. Each Attitude Control Motor corresponds to a Cartesian coordinate in a 3-dimensional plane (x, y, z).
3. When the Attitude Control Motors receive the request for an attitude change, the spacecraft will reorient itself and send back to ground control its new attitude as well as which planet it is currently pointing to.
4. When the spacecraft receives new coordinates, it starts from its current attitude when calculating a new attitude.
5. The spacecraft will always start its position at `(0, 0, 0)`. The Attitude Control Motors only change its orientation.
6. The solution should execute and wait for command-line input for a space-separated coordinate position.

**Sensitive Planets in each quadrant:**
- **GRACE:** +x, +y, +z
- **BRAY:** +x, -y, +z
- **PRICE:** +x, +y, -z
- **MIG:** +x, -y, -z
- **WIEM:** -x, +y, +z
- **TURK:** -x, -y, +z
- **MROW:** -x, +y, -z
- **SEBAS:** -x, -y, -z
